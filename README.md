# Genie-Plugin-Template
This is a generic Genie Plug-in for use with creating custom Plug-ins in Genie. 

I plan to add more instructions on how to use the Plug-In. For now, this repository 
can be opened in Visual Basic (tested with VS Community 2019) and then compiled as a .DLL 

This project is intended for learning purposes and to help people who would like to create 
their own plug-ins for Genie. 

Note: Plus ensure the attached "Interfaces.DLL" is used with this project. This will ensure it's
backwards compatible with Genie 3.5 and the newer open-source Genie currently under development.

# Instructions
Compile the project in Visual Basic and copy the "My_Genie_Template.dll" file to the Plugins folder 
for Genie. 

Alternatively, copy the provided "My_Genie_Template.dll" file to the Plugins folder for Genie. 

# Note: This plug-in doesn't do anything, other than load in Genie and spawn a Genie Plug-in Window.
